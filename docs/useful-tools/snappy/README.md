# Snappy

## What is Snappy?

Snappy is a super handy tool that lets you create temporary screenshots / post-it notes on your screen. [Download it for Mac / Windows here](http://snappy-app.com/download).

## Handy Shortcuts

* `cmd + shift + 2` - Creates a Snappy screenshot of the specified area.
* `1, 2, ..., 0` - Changes the opacity (10%, 20%, ..., 100%)
* `V → drag` - Moves the image (default behaviour)
* `T → click` - Adds text to the image.
* `cmd (hold) → drag` - Allows you to draw annotations on the image.
* `cmd + C` - Copies the current snap to clipboard which will rich paste.
* `Enter` - Generates and copies a URL for this snappy to clipboard.
* `Right Click → Delete Snap` - Best way to remove after you're finished.

## Usage / Tips

I find that Snappy is most useful when tweaking / comparing front-end styles to the design. The best way to do this is to:

1. Take a Snappy of the design
2. Move it over your build in the browser
3. Reduce the opacity with the number keys

This is especially useful for:

- Absolutely positioned elements that are "randomly placed" in the design
- Checking the weight / size / spacing of typography
- Checking alignment of sections that have more complex grids
